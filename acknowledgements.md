Protocols were developed and adapted over the years by the Remus-Emsermann group at University of Canterbury and Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin.

Many of the general lab protocols were adapted from [https://www.addgene.org/protocols/#intro-lab-bench](https://www.addgene.org/protocols/#intro-lab-bench)

This space was inspired by [Lowe-Power](http://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu/protocols/)'s and [Mark Mandel](https://github.com/mjmlab/protocols)'s lab protocol repositories.
