# Glycerol Stocks

Glycerol stocks are important to store bacterial cultures. You don't want to lose months and years of work isolating, cloning and transforming strains to realise that they are not viable anymore after a period of time. Glycerol helps stabilising the cell membrane, while water crystals formed from thawing and freezing cycles might damage the cells permanently.

Glycerol stocks from overnight cultures are often at a concentration between 15-20% v/v. That means, for a 1 ml aliquot, you will add 700 µl overnight bacterial liquid culture to 300 µl of a 60% v/v sterile glycerol solution.

Once prepared, label your tube with a unique ID on the side and the tube cap. Use cryogenic labels for that.

Keep a record of your stocks, for example:

| ID    |   |   |
| ----- | - | - |
| RS-01 |   |   |
| RS-02 |   |   |

Store safely your stock in a -70°C freezer for long-term storage.
