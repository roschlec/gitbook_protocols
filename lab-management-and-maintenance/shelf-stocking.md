# Shelf Stocking

* Every solution must be label with the name of the solution, concentration, date, and person who prepared it!
* In general, you can store plates without antibiotics in the cold room can last for about a year; plates with antibiotics are best within two months (but depends on the antibiotic!). If possible, prepare fresh and only necessary quantities.
* If liquid media is cloudy, assume that is contaminated and needs to be disposed properly (generally by autoclaving, but always check).
* Regularly check media and throw out anything that looks contaminated or is too old.
