# ðŸ”¬ Welcome!

## Welcome aboard!

This compilation of protocols and general resources that will get you started or keep you on track (for the more seniors) after you spent months in front of your screen analysing data and decided to get back in the lab.

These are general guidelines for organising your lab work, good practices in a research lab, and the adequate use of equipment and kits.

### Table of Content

Protocols and general procedures are organised as followed:

* <mark style="color:orange;">**Lab Management and Maintenance -**</mark> General lab protocols related to stock solutions, sterilisation and waste disposal, glycerol stocks and record tracking in Labfolder&#x20;
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Molecular Biology -**</mark> Mostly related to DNA work and transferring DNA into bacterial hosts
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Microbiology -**</mark> Everything you'll need to know about working with bacteria. From starting a culture from glycerol stocks to competition assays
* <mark style="color:green;">**Plant Biology -**</mark> We work mainly with _Arabidopsis thaliana_ as plant host, so here you'll find protocols to grow axenic arabidopsis plants and ways to inoculate them with bacteria
